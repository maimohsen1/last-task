Technique | Type | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Use Case
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) | Model-Agnostic | - Easy to implement- Provides local explanations for individual predictions | - Explanation changes depending on the sample- Slower with large models | Explaining individual predictions
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) | Model-Agnostic (or Specific with Tree Explainer) | - Highly accurate- Provides contribution value of each feature- Consistent explanations | - Computationally heavy with large datasets- More complex to understand | Explaining individual predictions or the entire model
Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) | Model-Agnostic | - Easy to plot and interpret- Shows average effect of a feature on predictions | - Assumes feature independence (which might not hold in practice) | Explaining the average effect of a particular feature
Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) | Model-Agnostic | - Answers "what-if" scenarios- Suggests actionable changes to input | - Slow with large models- Sometimes generates impractical counterfactuals | Generating actionable, human-understandable alternatives
